# Lab Report : PIN lab

## Protecton from BuggyApps

This pintools will replace the unsafe functions with the safe functions (with certain buffer size limitation). And it can protect it from segmentation fault after testing.

Please refer to [doc.md](doc.md) for documentations and [unsafe_func_replacer.cpp](pintools/unsafe_func_replacer.cpp).
